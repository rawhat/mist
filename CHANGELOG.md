## v0.8.0

- BREAKING:
  - refactor `http.handle` and `http.handle_func` into separate module

The `handler_func` implementation was about 250 lines. That seemed a little
excessive and unclear, so I just pulled that stuff out into separate functions.
I also thought it might be nice to have a separate `handler` module that housed
this code. The actual consumer changes are minimal.

## v0.7.1

## Note

I started this list way later and don't really feel like going back further
than this.
